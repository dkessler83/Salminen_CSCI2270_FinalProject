# Repo for CSCI2270 Data Structures Final Project

### Group Members:
Davis Kessler, Paul Salminen

### Project Description:
In this project, we will be creating a class to analyze Basketball information to provide statistics based on the data received. The data is a tsv file included in this repo for every game in the 2014-2015 Regular season. Each line has each time that played in a game, along with each score. From this, we will find the wins, losses, win/lose ratio, and number of points scored for each team. 

### How to run:
The information will come from a tsv file, and  will be inputted as a command line arguement. From there, you will be given choices of what kind of analysis you would like to do on the data. *More to come*

### System Requirements:
This project was built on Fedora Linux and Mac. However, there should be no requirements to run this program except for a c++ compiler.
